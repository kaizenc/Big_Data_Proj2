# Big_Data_Proj_2
Project 2 for Big Data; CS493 Hunter College

## How to use:
* Create a text file with a document per line: 'doc1 word1 word2 word3 \n doc2 word3 word2 ...'

* Either use `make run FILENAME='filename_here'` or `python3 app.py -f filename_here`

  * In either case, running the command without a file defaults the program to use test_file.txt

* The program will return the top 5 most similar words with the cosine similarity represented beside it

  * Currently, the program also filters out any words that don't match the RegEx expression `'^gene_.*_gene$'`

## What is happening?

### Problem
* Given m documents, compute the term-term relevance using
MapReduce and Spark

* Input: A text file, each line represents a document

* Output: A list of term-term pairs sorted by their similarity descending
t1 t2 s1 t3 t4 s2


### Sub-problems:
* Compute Term Frequency â€“ Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
for each term

* Output: mxn matrix (m: #documents, n: #terms)

* Computer and sort term-term relevance between a query term and all terms associated with the TF-IDF matrix

* Input: a query term t

* Output: term-term relevance between the query term and those terms in the tfidf matrix sorted by the relevance score (descending)
